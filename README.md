# Assignment Details

You need to build a `desktop web application` for `keeping notes`. You can draw inspiration from `Google Keep`. Here are the features that you need to build:
-   User Authentication and content sync
-   **Menu Features to contain**
-       Create a new note

# Frameworks & Constraints
-   Use NodeJS for backend APIs and setup user authentication & user profile. 
-   We want you to build the frontend application without the use of any frontend framework. 
-   You are allowed to use jQuery if you wish. 
-   For backend, You can use NodeJS or any other JS backend framework.

# Bonus Features
-   Special View - Reminder [view all notes with an upcoming due date]
-   Bonus point for submitting a video demo explaining the functionality of your app

# Completion 
-   Itâ€™s a self paced assignment and no restrictions on usage of Google/ ChatGPT but you should own the code submitted for your final evaluation. Ideally, you should spend 6-8 hours for the assignment if you have worked in NodeJS (Authentication & CRUD operations) but if it takes more time, you are free to spend as much time needed to complete the assignment. 

-   Please ensure to deploy your code on a public link for the reviewer to view your assignment.

-   Please note that you will have the ownership of the code submission and you are free to use it in your resume/ github profile/ etc. 

# Note

-   There are no restrictions on tools or resources; the main requirement is that you understand and can explain your implementation. Use Node.js for backend, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React for frontend.
